    "We can add print statements to our code at specific points to figure out certain things about the program state. We might want to know the specific values of certain variables, or whether certain branches of an if-else statement are being executed. It's usually a good idea to ensure print statements are descriptive enough to help you know what's going on, (e.g. label variables if you print multiple things at once), and to think about where you put print statements so you don't get overwhelmed with output.\n",

    "* Can slow down the program\n",
    "* Printing too much can cause the kernel to crash\n",
    "* Need to remember to remove print statements when you're done\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a debugger\n",
    "If you use JupyterLab, you can use the built-in debugger (see [this tutorial](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/debugger.html)). \n",
    "VSCode and other IDEs also tend to have good debuggers. See [this tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_debug-a-jupyter-notebook) for how to use the VSCode debugger with Jupyter notebooks. If you use another IDE, you can find out more by checking the documentation for your IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we want to add breakpoints at important points in our code and then step through our code line-by-line and verify that the program state is what we expect it to be. We can also inspect the values of variables at each step.\n",
